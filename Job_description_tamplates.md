# Job Description



## dev

>  Communicate and collaborate with scientists from diverse nationalities, backgrounds, and principals to design and develop software that processes human sequencing data. Apply the principles of software engineering and UI design to assist scientists in solving complex problems. Build distributed pipelines to segment data up to 10TB and extrapolate important biological insight using statistical models and machine learning techniques. Build quality, scalable, and easy-to-use C/C++, python, and Bash script applications independently. Refactor legacy pipelines to increase efficiency and reliability. Document and maintain software so that minimal human oversight is needed during operation. Present scientific findings to a variety of international scientific consortiums. draft high-quality manuscripts to detail scientific findings and submit them to top journals for peer review.


## Bioinfo
• Curate data, software, genome assembly pipeline for PacBio Hifi sequencing data, and visualization for publication on Nature, Science, PNAS, and other peer reviewed scientific journals.
• Independently run phased assemblies by combining PacBio data with 10x and strand-seq scaffold. 
• Wrote and maintained targeted assembly pipelines to resolve and visualizing large VNTR assemblies. 
• Predicted new gene models and amino-acid sequences using HiFi and IsoSeq data.
• Identify and structural variation(SV) and sites of autism and other neurological disease relevance
within human DNA as part of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, the Human Genome
Structural Variation Consortium, and the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, directly con-
tributing to projects with a combined budget of $15M/year.
• Created distributed application that segments data, which regularly exceeds 2 TB, and sent it to a DAG based workflow microservice orchestration. Jobs are distributed using Oracle Grid Engine on to the University of Washington’s high-performance computing cluster.
• Reduced processing time on legacy data pipeline by 90%
• Automated legacy pipeline and write unit tests so that no human oversight was necessary.
• Implemented statistical analyses (e.g. Bayesian phylogenetic inference) with Python, C, and Bash
