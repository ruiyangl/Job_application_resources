EXPERIENCE
----------
Tata Technologies Detroit MI
Application Developer Oct 2023 – Present
• Contribute to the development of a back-end Python software infrastructure for parallel HPC job submission
for 20+ CFD applications.
• Responsible for migrating the application from the in-house HPC PBS cluster to AWS EC2 instances with
FSx shared file system. Testing comparative performance of applications on HPC and AWS cloud.

Global Technology Inc. Sterling Heights, MI
Software Engineer Intern June 2023 – August 2023
• Independently developed and maintained an in-house, full-stack web application using React.js for front-
end, Python Flask for back-end, SQL for database, and RESTful API for Plex systems integration. De-
ployed the application with Docker on AWS cloud infrastructure, facilitating real-time data/document
sharing and project management. Projecting to save $10,000 in software subscription costs yearly.

Jinzhong(U.S.A) Auto Parts Manufacturing Co. LTD Sterling heights, MI
Project Manager July 2019 – Present
• Represent and oversee the company’s North American operations, including price negotiation, design,
manufacturing, and the warranty process for new ornaments tailored for North American customers such as
Tesla, Ford, GM, and Rivian.
• Managed cross-functional teams comprising project managers, design engineers, tooling engineers,
and suppliers to achieve stringent project timelines and budget constraints set by North American OEMs
and Tier One companies.
• Conducted thorough reviews of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) 3-D models, drawings, Finite Element Anal-
ysis (FEA), mold flow analysis, and stack-up analyses to furnish precise and timely information to clients.
• Delivered components for Ford’s upcoming electric SUV project ahead of schedule and within budget. This
achievement garnered client appreciation, leading to the award of their subsequent program, slated to replace
the current one.
• Draft the Failure Mode and Effects Analysys (FMEAs) for new ornaments for manufacturing in the US.
• Actively participated in weekly meetings with shareholders and financial advisors to determine the company’s
financial direction.
• Responsible for the digitization of the production process. Introduced a fully automated EDI system for
production management.Reduce the labor needed for inventory and project management by 50%.

University of Washington School of Medicine Seattle, WA
Research Software Developer 2018.03-2021.07
• Responsible for creating and implementing algorithms, data structure, statistical analyses, and visualizations
to identify and characterize sites of disease relevance within human DNA as part of the Human Pangenome
Reference Consortium, the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium, and the Simons Foun-
dation Autism Research Initiative, directly contributing to projects with a combined budget of $15M/year.
• Implemented computationally expensive string manipulations in C/C++, I/O heavy and visualization logic
with Python using Matplotlib and open-source data visualization tool Vega, and Bash to coordinate multiple
programs and data between them.
• Created novel data partitioning algorithm and implement advanced data structure to segment data sent to
snakemake for DAG based workflow microservice orchestration with jobs distributed using Oracle Grid
Engine.
• Computations executed on University of Washington’s high-performance computing cluster.
• Reduced processing time on legacy data pipeline by 90% via refactoring and the use of open source tools
such as Whatshap in Python and Bash
• Automated legacy pipeline so that no human oversight was necessary during processing.
• Legacy and new data processing pipelines regularly ingested over 2TB of data per process, however the
infrastructure had relatively limitless horizontal scaling (considering the upper bound on available data)
• Implemented statistical analyses (e.g. Bayesian phylogenetic inference) for output of data pipelines based on
laboratory spec with Python, C, and Bash.
• Created novel genomic application of prefix doubling algorithm to output a dot-plot visualization
• All data and visualizations, and software published in Nature, Science, PNAS, and other scientific journals.
Total citation over 250.
