### Message to Zev 
Subject: Eichler lab alummnus seeking to connect

Hello Zev,

I hope you're doing well. My name is Ruiyang. I worked at Evan's lab for a few years with Arvis and Pete. About a year ago Arvis sent you an email to connect us, and I wanted to reach out and follow up. At Eichler lab I independently run phased assemblies by combining PacBio data with 10x and strand-seq. I wrote and maintained many of our targeted assembly pipelines at the time and did some work at resolving and visualizing large VNTR assemblies. I also did some work predicting new gene models and amino-acid sequences using HiFi and IsoSeq data (now in Mao et al Nature 2021). I'm currently in a computer engineering MS program and about to graduate this year. I am looking for Bioinformatics and dev positions. I noticed that Pacific Biosciences is currently hiring bioinformaticians, and I am very interested in pursuing an opportunity with PacBio. If you could spear some time to connect and maybe chat, I would be incredibly grateful.

### Message to Bloomberg team (hlep from gpt-4) (not that good :( )

>Hello Ms. Ortiz,

> I hope this message finds you well. My name is Ruiyang Li, and I recently talked to Bradley Retterer during a Bloomberg campus event. He encouraged me to reach out to you and other Bloomberg recruiters. I hope you don't mind me contacting you directly.

> As a first-generation computer engineering student from China, I am reaching out to seek your guidance and advice in navigating the competitive tech market. I am eager to learn from your expertise and experience at Bloomberg.

> At the age of 17, I left China with a dream to become the first person in my family to make a living in the United States. I later graduated from the University of Washington, where I worked full-time as a researcher to support myself. During this period, I taught myself and fell in love with coding and contributed to advancing genetic disease treatment. While still an undergraduate student, my research led to several publications in top journals like Nature and Science, an achievement that fills me with immense pride.

> Unfortunately, the pressures of academia, coupled with a lack of coping mechanisms and loneliness, resulted in a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Consequently, I could not continue pursuing my Ph.D. Over the next two years, I focused on treatment and learned valuable life lessons, such as who to collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds and being mindful under pressure.

> During this time, I became captivated by financial technology after reading about financial legends like John Paulson and Mike Bloomberg. My participation in multiple Bloomberg campus events, including the puzzle competition, convinced me that Bloomberg is the ideal place to grow and develop my skills over the next five years.

> I am graduating from the University of Florida with a master's degree in computer engeering. My student visa status expires this year, and I am urgently seeking opportunities and guidance. I know your assistance will have a significant impact on my career trajectory, so if you could spare a few minutes to connect and answer some questions, I would be incredibly grateful.

> Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you soon.

> Warm regards,

> Ruiyang Li
