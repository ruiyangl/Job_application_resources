Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position in the Global Business Unit at Oracle. As a highly motivated and driven individual with a passion for technology, I believe that my programming skills and people skills make me an ideal candidate for this role.

I have completed my second year of undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at the University of Florida, where I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering degree. My academic achievements demonstrate my strong interest in technical areas of study. Furthermore, my experience as a Computational Biologist Technician at the University of Washington School of Medicine has provided me with invaluable experience in creating and implementing algorithms, data structures, statistical analyses, and visualizations to identify and characterize sites of disease relevance within human DNA.

Oracle is an exceptional employer that I have admired for its innovative spirit and commitment to excellence. The company's dedication to solving real-world problems using emerging technologies is inspiring. I am thrilled about the opportunity to work alongside industry experts and knowledgeable veterans who can guide me towards becoming a world-class software engineer.

My proficiency in C/C++, Python, Bash script, Linux, Grid engine, and Git aligns well with the OMQs required for this position. Additionally, my experience working on distributed applications that segment data exceeding 2 TB and implementing statistical analyses using Python, C, and Bash will be an asset to your team.

If chosen for this role, I am committed to contributing to Oracle's mission by designing and building innovative new systems from the ground up. My creativity and knowledge will enable me to write code, complete programming projects, perform testing and debugging of Oracle software while working collaboratively in an agile environment.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Oracle's success further.

Sincerely,
Ruiyang Li
